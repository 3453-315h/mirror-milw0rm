Description:
I'm not sure what to call this other than stupid. I
unintentionally found this exploit while testing out a
buffer overflow I also found in their software.

This exploit gives you access to any users account and
information inside of that account, and any access to
to every website the account is shared on. The user
database for Geffen/MCARecords.com is shared across all
of their websites.

The payload is that the site logs you in as the user you
specify, and sets a cookie on your computer which allows
you to stay logged in. You can then edit their profile,
retrieve their password, post news, ect..
--
What you need:
In order to login, all you need is the userid of the user
you wish to login as.

Example:
User: Geffen
Role: Administration
UserID: 1928

--
Vulnerability:
All that needs to be done is for you to post USERID
along with its value as plain text to any .asp page
on the website.

--
Proof of Concept:
Open the below in your browser, enter the userid of the
user you wish to login as into the blank feild and click
the login button, you will be redirected to the website
and logged in as that user.

&lt;form action=&quot;http://&lt;HOST&gt;/default.asp&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot;&gt;
&lt;input type=&quot;TEXT&quot; name=&quot;USERID&quot;&gt;
&lt;input type=&quot;SUBMIT&quot; name=&quot;SUBMIT&quot; value=&quot;Login&quot;&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
