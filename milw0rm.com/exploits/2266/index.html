by Tan Chew Keong
Release Date: 2006-08-28

Summary

A vulnerability has been found in Cybozu Products. When exploited, the vulnerability allows 
an authenticated user to retrieve arbitrary files accessible to the web server process.

Tested Versions
    * Cybuzu Office Version 6.5 (Build 1.2 20050427121735) for Windows
    * Cybozu Share 360 Version 2.5 (Build 0.2 20050121115231) for Windows


Details

This advisory discloses a directory traversal vulnerability in Cybozu products.
1) Cybozu Office File Cabinet File Download Directory Traversal

Cybuzu Office does not properly validate the &quot;id&quot; parameter in &quot;/scripts/cbag/ag.exe&quot; before 
using it to retrieve files from the file cabinet for a logon user. This allows a malicious user 
to retrieve arbitrary files accessible to the web server process using directory traversal characters.

Example (to retrieve the password hash of the admin page):

http://192.168.1.64/scripts/cbag/ag.exe?page=FileDownload&amp;id=../../../../../../../../../../../../../inetpub/scripts/cbag/cb5/data/admin&amp;notimecard=1&amp;type=text&amp;subtype=html&amp;ct=1
 

2) Cybozu Share 360 File Cabinet and Message Attachment Download Directory Traversal

Cybuzu Share 360 does not properly validate the &quot;id&quot; parameter in &quot;/scripts/s360v2/s360.exe&quot; 
before using it to retrieve files from the file cabinet and to retrieve file attachments from a 
received message/memo. This allows a malicious user to retrieve arbitrary files accessible to the 
web server process using directory traversal characters.

Example (to retrieve the password hash of the admin page):

http://192.168.1.64/scripts/s360v2/s360.exe?page=FileDownload&amp;id=../../../../../../../../../../inetpub/scripts/s360v2/s360v2/data/admin&amp;type=text&amp;subtype=plain&amp;ct=1&amp;.txt

http://192.168.1.64/scripts/s360v2/s360.exe?page=MessageDownload&amp;mid=37&amp;id=../../../../../../../../../../inetpub/scripts/s360v2/s360v2/data/admin&amp;bc=1&amp;type=text&amp;subtype=plain&amp;ct=1&amp;.txt
