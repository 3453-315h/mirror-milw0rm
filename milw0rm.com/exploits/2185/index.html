## Description: this is yet another exploit for the cyrus pop3d buffer overflow. I tried both public
##  exploits and not either of them worked (not that they don't but coding my own is generaly faster
##  and easier) so I coded my own. The exploit by kcope seems to be done right and maybe i just got realy
##  unlucky and missed the offset in between the 5 runs i gave it. The one from bannedit was interesting...
##  realy nice idea about overwriting the pointer and sticking your shellcode in GOT. Only problem is that
##  when i was writing this exploit with the same method, and i placed my shellcode in GOT, functions before
##  the return from the vuln function where segfaulting first by trying to actualy *use* the GOT! So what I have
##  done here is used the same method, yet found a data area that is not going to freak pop3d
##  out before it gets to the return. Specificy I use part of the .data segment (or was it .bss, anyways) labeled
##  'buf'. With this the same one-offset-per-machine is gained that bannedit was achieving. 
##
## Other: Basicly what all this means, is you just have to give an offset that is a location in memory that
##  is writeable and executable (anything in .data, .bss, .stack, .heap, etc) and make sure it's not something
##  that will need to be used by functions in pop3d before popd_canon_user() returns and hence executes your
##  shellcode (because it'll segfault and won't get executed).
##
## Note: bindport is 13370
