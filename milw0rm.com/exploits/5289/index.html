2604 (Quagga/OSPF) /TCP, even though the password of the appliance has 
been changed an attacker can still use the default password ‘zebra’ to 
log into the Quagga/Zebra service to view and manipulate the routing 
information etc. of the appliance. 

The vulnerability was discovered on ZyWall 1050 appliance other versions 
could be affected as well.
