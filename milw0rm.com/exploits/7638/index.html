====Exploit====

After registered and logged in, a user can upload any type of file in &quot;My Picture Album&quot; where a picture would usually be uploaded. 
For example, if the file &quot;shell.php&quot; was uploaded to somesite.com, its location would likely be

http://somesite.com/uploads/pictures/pictures/[user]/[picture number]_shell.php 

The location of the file can also easily be found by using your browser's &quot;view image&quot; function where the image would appear regularly.
