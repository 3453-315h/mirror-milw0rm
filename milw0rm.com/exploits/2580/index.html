# Writing to roots crontab seems to be fairly prompt at handing out root shells
# Make sure that you get cron running by first creating a user crontab!
#
# This is an exploit for a 3rd party program that has been bundled with Xcode on several
# occasions. The OpenBase binary creates a root owned log file 'simulation.sql' in the database path.
# Since we control the database path via directory transversal and we also control the umask we can
# create a file anywhere on the filesystem that is rw-rw-rw and owned by root.
#
# Following symlinks is bad mmmmmmmmmmkay!
