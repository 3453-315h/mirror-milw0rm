# sendtemp.pl: A part of the Amaya Web development
# server contains a file disclosure  vulnerability, 
# which allows remote, read access to files 
# on the servers file system,  as whichever 
# user the httpd is running as.
#
# The Vulnerability is really quite simple..
# When the `templ` argument is past to
# sendtemp.pl it adds a link to the chosen stylesheet
# and a META field containing the publication's 
# URL of the new file to the chosen template.
# For example:
# http://localhost/cgi-bin/sendtemp.pl?templ=template.xml
# This is all well and good,  however.. 
# There is no sanity checking on the param you pass to the script..
# Ie: my $temp_file = param(&quot;templ&quot;);
#
# So by simply issuing a GET to:
# &quot;http://localhost/cgi-bin/sendtemp.pl?templ=../../etc/passwd&quot;
# The systems file system can be traversed and the passwd file can be read. 
# (Assuming the http daemon hasn't been run under chroot())
#
# Follows is a simple exploit.. however, its just as easy 
# to do this manually in your web browser.
# I really couldnt be bothered to format the output in any way,
# It only encourages script kiddies.
#
# Finally, &quot;l33t hax0r greetz&quot; to..
