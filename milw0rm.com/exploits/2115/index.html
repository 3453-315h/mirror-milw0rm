<html><head><title>Kayako eSupport <= 2.3.1 (subd) Remote File Inclusion Vulnerability</title></head><pre>Script: Kayako eSupport &lt;= 2.3.1
Vendor: Kayako (www.kayako.com)
Discovered: beford &lt;xbefordx gmail com&gt;
Comments: It seems like the vendor silently fixed the issue in the
current version (more like since v2.3.5) withouth warning users of
previous versions, noobs. Requires that &quot;register_globals&quot; is enabled.
Vulnerable File: esupport/admin/autoclose.php

[code]
require_once $subd . &quot;functions.php&quot;;
[/code]

Not-leet-enough: &quot;Powered By Kayako eSupport&quot;
