<html><head><title>Cuteflow 2.10.3 edituser.php Security Bypass Vulnerability</title></head><pre>It's possible edit the users (including the admin account), 
bypassing the authentication through the address:
http://localhost/cuteflow/pages/edituser.php?userid=1&amp;language=pt&amp;sortby=st rLastName&amp;sortdir=ASC&amp;start=1

The vulnerability is caused due to the application not properly 
restricting access to the pages/edituser.php script. This can be 
exploited to modify a user's username and password without having 
proper credentials.
