<html><head><title>Visual Basic (vbe6.dll) Local Stack Overflow PoC / DoS</title></head><pre>Stack overflow in vbe6.dll, (used by all versions of MS Office)
The overflow occurs in Visual Basic for Application. 
Creating a property with a long name ( about 247 chars) results in a stack overflow in vbe6.dll which overwrites with a null byte the first byte of the return address.

Probably impossible to exploit, but who knows? ^^ At least, there still exist stack overflows in Office apps :P
