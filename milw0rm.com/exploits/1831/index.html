tiffsplit from libtiff (http://www.remotesensing.org/libtiff/)
is vulnerable to a bss-based and stack-based overflow, but, I just
wrote the concept c0de for stack-based b0f 'cause I don't know how
to take advantage of the overwritten bss data (after the overflow,
that data is overwritten again correctly by a program' function).
